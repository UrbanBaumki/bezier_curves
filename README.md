# Bezier Curves drawing/calculating app

A simple web app for drawing interpolated bezier curves with matrix transforms. I haven't used any external librarys for this, so I had to implement matrix class myself.

Curves editor is currently not functional, since it hasn't been update yet. 
But the drawing works perfectly.
